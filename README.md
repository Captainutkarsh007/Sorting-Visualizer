# Sorting-Visualizer
This project is a very simple UI and it allows the users to visualize different sorting algorithms. I have given an option to select the array size, and speed of the visualization and the sorting algorithm. Each element of the array is displayed as a bar. The operations are colour coded such that:

Blue - Element is in unsorted position
Yellow - Selected
Red - Swap the bars
Green - Element is in sorted position
